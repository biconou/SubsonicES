            the same way as other Sonos music services like Spotify or Google Play.

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Subsonic web page, enable the Sonos music service in <b>Settings &gt; Sonos</b>.</li>
            <li>In the Sonos controller, click <b>Add Music Services</b> and select Subsonic.</li>
            <li>Select <b>I already have an account</b>, then enter your Subsonic username and password.</li>
            <li>You're done. The list of music sources now includes the Subsonic music service.</li>

        <h3>Advanced settings</h3>

        <h4>Lossless audio</h4>
        <p>
            For maximum compatibility, Subsonic is by default transcoding non-mp3 music files to mp3 when streaming to Sonos.
            However, Sonos natively supports several other <a href="https://sonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/80/~/supported-audio-formats">audio formats</a>,
            such as FLAC and OGG.  To disable the transcoding in Subsonic, select <b>Settings &gt; Players</b>, select the
            Sonos player, and then disable the "mp3 audio" transcoding.
        </p>

        <h4>Multiple Subsonic servers</h4>
        <p>
            Sonos music services are uniquely identified by a "SID" (a number between 240 and 253). By default, Subsonic uses
            SID 242. If you want to make multiple Subsonic servers on your local network available to Sonos, you have to
            assign a unique SID to each server. This setting is not available through the web interface, but you can add this
            line to the subsonic.properties file (located in /var/subsonic, c:/subsonic or /Library/Application Support/Subsonic)
            to change it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                SonosServiceId=243
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember to restart Subsonic to make it take effect.
        </p>

        <h4>Using a remote Subsonic server</h4>
        <p>
            Subsonic automatically configures Sonos players on your local network. If Subsonic and Sonos are not on the
            same network you can still connect them, using a manual one-time registration procedure. Make sure you have the
            IP address of the Sonos player and Subsonic server available. You can find the Sonos IP by selecting <b>About my Sonos System</b>
            in the Sonos controller app.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <b>http://SONOS_IP:1400/customsd.htm</b> in a browser.</li>
            <li>Enter the following values in the web form:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>SID</b> &ndash; Any legal value except 242</li>
                    <li><b>Service Name</b> &ndash; Any name, for instance "Subsonic Remote"</li>
                    <li><b>Endpoint URL</b> &ndash; http://SUBSONIC_IP:4040/ws/Sonos</li>
                    <li><b>Secure Endpoint URL</b> &ndash; http://SUBSONIC_IP:4040/ws/Sonos</li>
                    <li><b>Polling Interval</b> &ndash; 1200</li>
                    <li><b>Authentication</b> &ndash; Session ID</li>
                    <li><b>Strings Table</b> &ndash; Version: 5, URI: http://SUBSONIC_IP:4040/sonos/strings.xml</li>
                    <li><b>Presentation Map</b> &ndash; Version: 1, URI: http://SUBSONIC_IP:4040/sonos/presentationMap.xml</li>
                    <li><b>Container Type</b> &ndash; Music Service</li>
                    <li><b>Capabilities</b> &ndash; Search, Favorites, Extended Metadata</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Finally, in the Sonos controller, click <b>Add Music Services</b> and select the newly added Subsonic music service.
