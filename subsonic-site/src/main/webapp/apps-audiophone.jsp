    <strong>Listen to your music, anywhere</strong>

    <p>
        Browse and play your personal collection over WiFi or cellular networks. Don't be limited by free space
        on your mobile device, or the cable tethering you to iTunes.
    </p>

    <strong>Quickly access anything</strong>

    <p>
        No matter what you're looking for, it will be easy to find and get to within Audiophone. Whether you
        just want a mix based on your favorite genre, are looking to drill down your artist list to that one
        obscure name, or easily flick your collection aside to access what's currently playing, Audiophone makes
        it easy and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <strong>Seamless playback</strong>

    <p>
        You may not always have the best connection when we're on-the-go, but Audiophone has your back. By
        streaming just the music you need and pre-buffering songs before you want them, Audiophone utilizes your
        available bandwidth to its full capability. Not only that, but it offers gapless playback for a smooth
        experience.
    </p>

    <strong>AirPlay support</strong>

    <p>
        You spent hard earned money on that stereo system, and you made sure it was AirPlay compatible. Don't
        let it go to waste or burden yourself by running audio cables from your computer, use Audiophone and
        effortless play your music on the best speakers in the house.
