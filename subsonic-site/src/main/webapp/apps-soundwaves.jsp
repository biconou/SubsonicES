    <h3>Soundwaves for iPhone/iPad</h3>

    <p>
        Soundwaves focuses on simplicity, making it the ideal client to connect your iPad or iPhone to your home theater setup.
    </p>

    <p>
        Optionally setting a suitable max bit rate enables Soundwaves to work well even over a bandwidth-limited connection (e.g. a mobile connection).
        It will also play nicely with your car radio, connected via USB or Bluetooth.
